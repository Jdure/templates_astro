# Client Templates 
 
 ## Objective

There should be at least 2-3 templates for each of these pages. 

### Landing Page

Landing pages should be unique for the business. Most of the work should be to create the right landing page. 
Once that is complete then its a matter of selecting the right template that compliments the site.
