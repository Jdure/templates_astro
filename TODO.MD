# Client Templates

## Objective

The goal is to create client templates for 3 different personas.

1. Small business
2. Freelancers/Professionals

The following pages will be created for each:

-   About/About Us (w/Testimonials)
    -   [x] Small business 1
    -   [x] Small business 2
    -   [x] Freelancer 1
    -   [x] Freelancer 2 (w/Testimonials)
-   Services
    -   [x] Small business
    -   [x] Freelancer
-   Portfolio / Gallery
    -   [] Small business 1
    -   [] Small business 2
    -   [] Freelancer 1
    -   [] Freelancer 2
-   Contact Us (w/FAQ)
    -   [x] Small business
    -   [x] Freelancer

There should be at least 2-3 templates for each of these pages.

### Landing Page

Landing pages should be unique for the business. Most of the work should be to create the right landing page.
Once that is complete then its a matter of selecting the right template that compliments the site.
